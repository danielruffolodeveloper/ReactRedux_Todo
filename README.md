# React/Redux Todo List
A Simple todo list app (Yawn! I know), But one that takes advantage of Redux which makes accessing state between components significantly easier as it avoids passing props up and down.<br />
Clicking on a todo sets the indevidual item state to complete.<br />
This enables the ability to filter items by their completed state.

## How to run:
* Clone the repository and cd into the directory
* Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
* Run `npm start` and open the project on localhost:3000
* Create some TODO items!
